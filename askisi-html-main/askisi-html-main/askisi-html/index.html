                <p><strong>Elden Ring</strong> is an action RPG (<em>Role-Playing Game</em>) developed by
                    <strong>FromSoftware</strong> and released in 2022.<br>
                    The game combines intense action and the rich world of FromSoftware's previous titles, such as
                    <strong>Dark Souls</strong>, <strong>Bloodborne</strong>, and <strong>Sekiro</strong>, with an
                    open-world structure.<br>
                    Its story is the result of a collaboration between <strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki</strong> (<em>creator
                        of the Souls games</em>) and author <strong>George R. R. Martin</strong> (<em>known for the "A
                        Song of Ice and Fire" book series</em>).
